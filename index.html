                <h2>About Opossums</h2>
                <p>Opossums are marsupials that are native to the Americas. They are the only marsupials that are found
                    in the United States and Canada. Opossums are known for their unique behaviors and physical
                    characteristics. They are often misunderstood and underappreciated animals. Opossums are beneficial
                    to the environment because they eat insects, rodents, and other pests. They are also immune to
                    rabies and are resistant to snake venom. Opossums are solitary animals that are nocturnal and are
                    most active at night. They are excellent climbers and are known for their ability to escape from
                    predators by climbing trees. Opossums are also known for their ability to play dead when they are
                    threatened. They are gentle animals that are not aggressive and are not dangerous to humans.
                    Opossums are intelligent animals that are capable of learning and problem-solving. They are social
                    animals that are capable of forming bonds with other opossums. Opossums are fascinating animals that
                    are worthy of our respect and admiration.</p>
